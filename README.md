# IPEDSpublic

IPEDSpublic is a mirror of the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) Integrated Postsecondary Education Data Systemm (IPEDS) data repository. Files were initially downloaded in Feb, 2025.

New files will be added as (and if) they become available.

We strive to mirror the taxonomies contained [Use the data](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data) page, while improving the interface for ease of use.
